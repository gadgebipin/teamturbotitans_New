    <h1>Team TurboTitans</h1>
    <p>Team Turbo Titans from Amrutvahini College of Engineering is an enthusiastic and dedicated group of engineering
      students passionately participating in the REEV (Range-Extended Electric Vehicle) competition organized by SAE
      India. Comprising bright minds with a shared vision for innovation in electric mobility, the team is committed to
      revolutionizing the automotive industry through sustainable and high-performance electric vehicles.</p>
    <p>Driven by a blend of technical expertise, creativity, and a pursuit of excellence, the Turbo Titans aim to
      redefine the boundaries of electric vehicle technology. Their participation in the competition signifies their
      dedication to advancing the development of range-extended electric vehicles, aiming to create innovative solutions
      that prioritize efficiency, sustainability, and performance.</p>
    <p>With a strong focus on teamwork, problem-solving, and practical application of engineering principles, the Turbo
      Titans are geared up to showcase their skills, knowledge, and innovative ideas in building an exceptional
      range-extended electric vehicle. Their involvement in the REEV competition stands as a testament to their commitment
      to shaping the future of mobility and contributing to a greener tomorrow.</p>
    <p>We are a team of 25 students and 5 systems, including:</p>
    <h2>1. CHASSIS DESIGN SYSTEM</h2>
    <p>Designing a chassis is like crafting the backbone of a vehicle or a machine. It’s the skeletal framework that
      supports and holds together all the critical components. A well-thought-out chassis design considers factors like
      structural integrity, weight distribution, material strength, and overall functionality. It’s the canvas upon which
      the rest of the vehicle or machine is built, influencing its performance, durability, and sometimes even its
      aesthetic appeal.</p>
    <h2>2. ELECTRICAL SYSTEM</h2>
    <p>An electrical system is akin to sculpting the nervous system of a machine or device. It serves as the vital network
      that conducts power and information, much like nerves transmitting signals within a body. An adeptly designed
      electrical system considers crucial elements such as voltage requirements, power distribution, circuit protection,
      and robustness. It acts as the backbone for all electronic components, ensuring seamless functionality and
      efficiency.</p>
    <h2>3. TRANSMISSION SYSTEM</h2>
    <p>The transmission system of a range-extended electric vehicle plays a pivotal role in optimizing power
      distribution. Integrating an electric motor generator, it offers seamless transition between battery power and an
      onboard generator, often powered by a combustion engine. This innovative setup enhances the vehicle's overall range
      by efficiently recharging the battery while in motion.</p>
    <p>The transmission system is vital for range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) as it optimizes power distribution
      between the electric motor and range-extending generator. This seamless coordination enhances energy efficiency,
      maximizes electric driving range, and ensures optimal performance during extended journeys. The transmission system
      allows for dynamic adjustments, providing smooth transitions between electric and generator modes, thereby
      enhancing overall driving experience and making REEVs a practical and versatile solution for sustainable
      mobility.</p>
    <h2>4. STEERING SYSTEM</h2>
    <p>The steering system in a vehicle allows the driver to control the direction of movement by turning the wheels. The
      steering system converts rotary motion of the steering wheel into the angular turn of wheels to guide the vehicle
      in the required direction. The rack and pinion steering system is one of the most prevalent types of steering
      systems in modern vehicles. It offers direct feedback, allowing drivers to feel the road better and requires less
      maintenance than other systems.</p>
    <p>The primary components include: Steering wheel, steering column, tie rod, rack and pinion, steering arm, etc.</p>
